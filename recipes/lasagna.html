        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Lasagna is a popular Italian dish that has become a favorite worldwide. It is a type of pasta that is layered with a tomato-based sauce, cheese, and sometimes meat or vegetables. The layers are usually topped off with a final layer of cheese and baked in the oven until golden brown. The tomato sauce gives lasagna a rich and tangy flavor, while the cheese adds a creamy and savory element to the dish. Lasagna can be made with a variety of ingredients to suit different tastes and preferences, making it a versatile meal option. It is also a great dish to make in advance and reheat, making it perfect for feeding large groups or for meal prepping.

            Although lasagna has its roots in Italian cuisine, it has evolved over time to suit different cultures and tastes. For example, some people prefer to use different types of cheese, such as ricotta or mozzarella, while others like to add spinach or other vegetables to the dish. Some variations of lasagna also use a creamy white sauce instead of the traditional tomato-based sauce. Whether you prefer a classic lasagna or a more modern twist on the dish, there is no denying the deliciousness of this hearty and comforting meal.</p>
